This is a CAS-enabled test application.  To run it successfully, a CAS
server is required.  The URL for the CAS server is configured in the
[application.groovy](test1/grails-app/conf/application.groovy)
file.  Setting up a CAS server is out of the scope of this document, but
good places to start are [Apereo CAS GitHub](https://github.com/apereo/cas)
and the [CAS Initializr](https://getcas.apereo.org/ui) service.

The test application can be run with:

`./gradlew :testapp-spring-security-cas-test1:bootRun`

The test application URLs are:
* [http://localhost:8081/secure/admins](http://localhost:8081/secure/admins)
* [http://localhost:8081/secure/users](http://localhost:8081/secure/users)

The test app creates the `admin` and `user` users in
[BootStrap.groovy](test1/grails-app/init/spring/security/cas/test/BootStrap.groovy). 
The password is the same as the username.
