# build-logic
The Grails project is structured into 3 separate composite builds. Composite builds make use of Gradle's `includeBuild` feature, which do not share Gradle plugins from `buildSrc`. This project exists to share internal Gradle plugins across all 3 separate builds.


The `plugins` project holds the shared convention plugins. The `vulnerability-scan` project holds only the `org.apache.grails.buildsrc.vulnerability-scan` plugin, because the Sonatype scan plugin it wraps is a fat jar that bundles Guava, Groovy and other libraries without relocating them; keeping it in its own project keeps those bundled classes off the settings classpath that every build shares when it requests a plugin from `plugins`.
