/**
 * {@link ClassCodeVisitorSupport} that detects GORM HQL/Cypher query text built from a
 * {@link GStringExpression} that Groovy coerced to a plain {@code String} <em>before</em> it
 * reaches a GORM query method, e.g.:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * String query = "from Book where name = ${userInput}"   // coerced to String right here
 * Book.executeQuery(query)                                // -> raw, unescaped text, no binding
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>When a {@link groovy.lang.GString} is passed directly to a GORM query method, GORM binds
 * each interpolated value as a query parameter — safe. Once the {@code GString} has been coerced
 * to a {@code String} (an explicit {@code String}-typed local, a {@code .toString()} call, or an
 * {@code as String}/cast coercion), that information is gone: a {@code String} carries no trace
 * of ever having been a {@code GString}, so this can only be caught here, before the coercion
 * erases it — a runtime check at the query boundary is structurally blind to this case.
 *
 * <p>A {@code GString} does not have to be flattened directly at the call site to be unsafe —
 * aliasing it through one or more intermediate variables still loses the binding the moment it is
 * assigned to a {@code String}-typed variable, however many hops away that happens:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * def g = "from Book where name = ${userInput}"   // g: still a live GString
 * String q = g                                     // flattened HERE, not at the executeQuery call
 * Book.executeQuery(q)
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p><strong>Query text vs. values.</strong> Only an interpolation that can carry runtime data is
 * a finding. An interpolated expression that is <em>constant text</em> cannot be influenced by
 * user input, so a {@code GString} whose interpolations are all constant text is treated exactly
 * like a plain {@code String} literal. Constant text is: a literal; a {@code static final} field
 * initialised from constant text; a ternary or Elvis expression choosing between constant text; a
 * {@code +} concatenation, {@code GString}, cast or {@code .toString()} of constant text; and a
 * local variable that only ever held constant text on every path reaching the use. This is what
 * lets query text be assembled from fixed HQL fragments chosen at runtime, which a {@code GString}
 * passed directly to GORM could not express (GORM would bind the fragment as a parameter value):
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * String restriction = ""
 * if (params.title) {
 *     restriction = " and b.title = :title"      // constant text, chosen at runtime
 *     queryParams.title = params.title           // the value is bound, never interpolated
 * }
 * String query = "from Book b where 1 = 1 ${restriction}"   // not a finding
 * Book.executeQuery(query, queryParams)
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>Compound assignment with {@code +=} is tracked exactly like {@code x = x + y}: a constant
 * local stays constant when the appended text is constant, a live {@code GString} operand is
 * flattened (Groovy's {@code GString.plus} returns {@code String}), and an already-flattened one
 * stays flattened. The same holds for any {@code +} concatenation: a flattened or live
 * {@code GString} operand anywhere in it makes the whole result flattened, not merely a
 * lower-confidence concatenation.
 *
 * <p><strong>Control flow.</strong> Local tracking is flow-sensitive. The branches of an
 * {@code if}/{@code else} and the cases of a {@code switch} (including fall-through) are each
 * walked from the state before the statement and merged pessimistically afterwards: a variable
 * unsafe at the end of any path stays unsafe, and is constant text only if it is constant at the
 * end of every path. A {@code catch} block starts from the merge of every state its {@code try}
 * block passed through, since an exception may leave the block after any statement, and a
 * {@code finally} block is checked against every path into it. A loop body or closure body may
 * run any number of times, so a body that assigns a local declared outside it is re-walked from
 * the merged loop-head state until that state is stable before findings are reported: an
 * assignment late in the body is seen by a use earlier in it, which the next iteration reaches.
 * {@code break}, {@code continue} and, in a closure, {@code return} carry their state to the
 * exit or head they jump to, and a path ending in such a jump or in {@code throw} contributes
 * nothing to the state after the statement. A jump or an exception that leaves a {@code try}
 * statement runs its {@code finally} block first, so it carries the state that block ends with
 * when walked from every path into it. Locals are tracked per declaration, so a later local,
 * parameter or loop variable that reuses a name never inherits the state of an earlier one.
 *
 * <p>Some assignments can run at a point the walk cannot place: inside a closure or the code of
 * an anonymous inner class, which may run at any later point; inside another expression, such
 * as a ternary or Elvis branch, an {@code &&} or {@code ||} operand, a method argument or a loop
 * condition; or through multiple assignment. A local assigned in any of these ways, and a local
 * declared outside a closure that the closure reads, counts as constant text (there, or for a
 * local a closure or an anonymous inner class assigns, anywhere) only when every assignment to
 * it in the method is constant text.
 *
 * <p>This is a build-breaking error for the local-variable case above, because the detection is
 * precise: every flattening point is visible in the method being compiled. Two related patterns
 * are lower-confidence and instead reported as compile-time <em>warnings</em>, which do not fail
 * the build:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li><strong>Fields.</strong> A {@code String}-typed field initialized from an interpolated
 *     {@code GString}, or assigned one via {@code this.field = ...}, that later reaches a query
 *     method through {@code this.field}. Unlike locals, a field can be reassigned from a
 *     constructor, another method, or a subclass that this check never visits, so it is flagged
 *     rather than failed.</li>
 *     <li><strong>String concatenation.</strong> Query text built with {@code +} from a
 *     non-constant value and no {@code GString} involved at all, e.g.
 *     {@code "select ... " + userInput}. This is a real injection shape, but concatenation is
 *     common enough for benign, non-query purposes that a hard failure would be too blunt an
 *     instrument. Concatenating only constant text, as defined above, is not a finding.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Both warnings share the same {@link #SUPPRESS_WARNINGS_VALUE} suppression as the error case.
 * The suppression applies to the enclosing method or class, or - more narrowly - to a single
 * local variable or field declaration: {@code @SuppressWarnings("GormUnsafeQueryString") String
 * query = ...} marks that variable as reviewed for the rest of the method, whatever it is later
 * assigned, and leaves every other variable checked. A reviewed variable is also treated as
 * constant text wherever it is interpolated or concatenated, so the annotation may go either on
 * the assembled query or on the fragment it is built from.
 *
 * <p><strong>Known limitations (deliberate scope):</strong>
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Intraprocedural only — a flattened {@code String} built inside a helper method and
 *     returned to the caller is invisible to this check, and so is constant text returned from
 *     one (it is treated as data).</li>
 *     <li>Constant-text tracking follows locals, {@code static final} fields, ternaries and
 *     {@code +}/{@code +=}/{@code GString} composition only - not collections (for example
 *     fragments gathered in a {@code List} and joined), method calls, or non-final fields.</li>
 *     <li>Flow-sensitivity applies to locals only; field tracking is last-write-wins in source
 *     order. Outside constant-text tracking, a closure body is analysed with the state at the
 *     point the closure is defined, so a local flattened between the definition and the call is
 *     not seen inside it. An anonymous inner class is analysed as a class of its own, so a local
 *     of the enclosing method that it reads is treated as data there, and one that it flattens is
 *     not seen as flattened by the enclosing method. Reachability is approximated: a path is
 *     treated as not continuing only when its block ends in {@code return}, {@code throw},
 *     {@code break} or {@code continue}.</li>
 *     <li>Field tracking only recognizes a directly-interpolated {@code GString} initializer or
 *     {@code this.field = ...} assignment - it does not follow aliasing chains or
 *     {@code .toString()}/cast coercions the way local tracking does.</li>
 *     <li>Does not detect raw JDBC via {@code groovy.sql.Sql}, or any datastore whose query
 *     methods use names outside {@link #CANDIDATE_METHODS}.</li>
 * </ul>
