/**
 * Covers which Java compiles a project's pages.
 *
 * <p>Compilation is forked, and a forked process runs whatever JVM it is given. Left to itself it
 * inherits the one running Gradle, so a project that asked for a toolchain had its pages built by a
 * different Java from everything else it built. Nothing failed at build time: the mismatch surfaced
 * as an {@code UnsupportedClassVersionError} the first time a page was rendered.</p>
