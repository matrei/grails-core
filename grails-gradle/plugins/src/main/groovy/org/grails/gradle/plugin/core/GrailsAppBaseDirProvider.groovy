/**
 * Provides the {@code -Dbase.dir} system property (see {@link BuildSettings#APP_BASE_DIR})
 * to forked JVM tasks.
 *
 * The directory is marked {@link Internal} rather than {@code @InputDirectory} because
 * the project directory encompasses task output directories (e.g. {@code build/}).
 * Declaring it as {@code @InputDirectory} causes Gradle to report implicit dependency
 * violations between the consuming task (e.g. {@code test}) and every task that writes
 * into the project directory (e.g. {@code compileIntegrationTestGroovy}, {@code jar}).
 * The actual inputs that matter for caching (classpath, source sets) are already tracked
 * by their respective tasks.
