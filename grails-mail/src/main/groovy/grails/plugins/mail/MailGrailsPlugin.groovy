        This plugin provides a MailService class as well as configuring the necessary beans within
        the Spring ApplicationContext.
        
        It also adds a "sendMail" method to all controller classes. A typical example usage is:
        
        sendMail {
            to 'fred@g2one.com','ginger@g2one.com'
            from 'john@g2one.com'
            cc 'marge@g2one.com', 'ed@g2one.com'
            bcc 'joe@g2one.com'
            subject 'Hello John'
            text 'this is some text'
        }
