/**
 * Registers the controller a scaffolded resource is served by, and the templates its pages are
 * found by.
 *
 * <p>Its actions are reached through Groovy, including the protected ones it defines for the write
 * operations, so an image that keeps only the members something asked for serves the pages and then
 * fails on the request that saves or removes a record.</p>
 *
 * <p>The pages themselves are compiled by the build, but the resolver still reads the template a
 * page was expanded from, because the page is named for it. An image without the templates finds no
 * template, and so no page, for any scaffolded view.</p>
